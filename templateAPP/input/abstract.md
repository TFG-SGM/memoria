The DIPAMIA project (Diagnosis of Pathologies through Movement Analysis using Artificial Intelligence) focuses on analyzing movement to diagnose conditions such as depression. One of the key elements of this project is the Web platform responsible for collecting, managing, and displaying project-related information. This Web application will be used by healthcare specialists, movement specialists, and technical personnel working with data processing. Ultimately, patients will also use the platform to access information related to their treatment. In this context, the development of the Web application is the objective of this Final Degree Project. A preliminary study of the most suitable technologies for the project's development will be conducted. Additionally, to implement a user-centered methodology, interviews will be conducted with stakeholders to gather the necessary information for the project's development. Subsequently, the most appropriate visualization techniques will be analyzed based on the preliminary steps to implement the Web application. Finally, usability studies will be conducted to improve the system's use.
